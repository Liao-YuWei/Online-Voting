## Source Code
https://github.com/Liao-YuWei/Online-Voting  

## How to run?
1. Run `python ./src/server.py`
2. Run `python ./src/client.py`


## Design

We use Python to implement the voting server.

## Implementation
- Local Server API
Implemented RegisterVoter and UnregisterVoter. 
Example can be seen in server.py -> eVotingServicer -> init function
    - RegisterVoter: we use dict to keep track of users which stores their name, voter group and public key.
    - UnregisterVoter: able to remove a user from the dict

- RPC APIs
    - PreAuth: using secrets module to generate token, users are appended inside a dict with token attached to their names.
    - Auth: we then verify whether the public key matches with user’s. Server will then return authentication token also generated by secrets module back to the user.
    - CreatElection: Check token, groups and choices specification. If legal, create a new election.
    - CastVote:Check token, election name and group. If legal, client can vote an election.
    - GetResult: Check election status and get result of election.
